# nfl-ds-project

The aim of this project is to analyse an NFL play-by-play data source from 2009-18.

There seems to be a key issue with missing data values and missing column metadata. These two things should be tacked first.

There are some key predictions I want to investigate:
  1. Predicting the yards gained on a play?
  2. Predict whether it will be a run or pass play?
  3. Predict whether the play will result in a 1st down?
  4. Predicting a turnover?
  5. Will a team go for it on 4th down?
  
Intresting data mining projects:
  1. How game trends change over time periods (types of plays over the years but also yearly trends like the number of passing yards increasing over time)
  2. Identify causal relationships for play behaviour (i.e. run or pass play)
